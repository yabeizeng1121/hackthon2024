## Background
Alexithymia is a condition which makes it difficult for individual to identify, experience and express emotions. One in 10 people in the general population have Alexithymia (Parker et al. 2008), while it is also highly prevalent among individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), ranging from 50% to 85%. Alexithymia conditions also tend to be highly associated with other psychiatric groups such as individuals with depression and anxiety symptoms (Bankier et al. 2001; McGillivray et al. 2017). In a workforce setting, Alexithymia may manifest in various ways that may impact job performance and interpersonal relationships. Studies have shown correlation between higher professional burnout levels and decreased ability in differentiating interlocutors emotions as well as decreased willingness in involving conversations (Chernus et al. 2021). 

## Project Goal
The goal of the project is to develop an Application to support people with Alexithymia conditions in identifying facial expressions of colleagues and employers in professional settings. Through accurately labeling the real-time facial expressions of interlocutors as well as providing appropriate suggestions for verbal and behavioral responses, the Application seeks to enhance interpersonal communications and interactions in workplace settings. Ultimately, this tool aims to remove impediment for people with Alexithymia conditions and foster more inclusive work atmosphere. 

## Function of App

1. Real Time Recognition of Participants Emotions: The camera frame on the right hand side is able to identify the real time (at every second) facial expressions of every participant.
2. Output Average Dominant Emotion: The top right column displays the dominant emotion for the working atmosphere for every 5 seconds. If there are multiple participants, the average emotion will be taken for the output dominant emotion.
3. Suggestions: The low right column on the App displays suggestions for the user’s responses. The suggestion is divided into potential verbal (language) responses and behavioral (action) responses. The users have freedom in selecting which verbal and/or behavioral responses they want to apply in the professional setting. 

## Commercial Viability & Future Deployment

1. Large Market Size: 1 in every 10 people have Alexithymia conditions
2. Adopting a monthly and yearly subscription plan
3. Partnering with health insurance companies to improve accessibility of the tool
4. Apply this AI technology to wearable devices (e.g. Apple Vision Pro or Meta Glass): This would smooth the user experience process and potentially make interlocutors more comfortable as their detected facial expressions are not shown to everyone in the conversation. 
	
## Responsible AI

1. Privacy Concern: This App involve real time monitor of participants in the professional settings which may raise privacy issues for those who want to avoid sharing their faces and facial expressions. This App will NOT store the video footages in memory, which could potentially remove some of the privacy concerns. However, consent and approval from participants are still required. The presence of the tool and scope of camera has to be visible and aware for every participant. 
2. Biases and Fairness: The emotion recognition model might have biased outcomes based on age, gender, ethnicity etc. While the facial recognition model is pre-trained on a diverse dataset (FER-2013), it might still have incorrect interpretations of facial expressions. Please be aware of these potential misrepresentations and avoid reinforcing stereotypes. 
3. User Education: Due to the limitations of AI in interpreting emotions, particularly in complex social settings with multiple participants (such as the professional settings in this scenario), users need to be educated before using the App. It should be clarify that the App is only a support tool that provides guidance on emotional interpretations, instead of an oversight tool. It should not replace genuine social interactions. 
4. Compliance and Approval: Signed documents from all participants on giving approval for the use of the App in public setting is important. Additionally, many workplaces have policies regarding employee monitoring and use of AI-driven tools. Approval from relevant HR or legal departments might also be required to ensure the app aligns with workplace regulations.
